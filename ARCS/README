SNS ARCS instrument simulation.

Applications
------------

 - arcs_beam: beam simulation
   - run arcs-m2s
     - run arcs_moderator2sample
   - run post processing
 - arcs-neutrons2nxs: scattered neutrons to det system and generate event mode nxs
   - arcs-neutron2events
   - arcs-events2nxs
 - arcs-nxs-populate-Eidata: add Ei-related data into event mode nxs
 - arcs-reduce-nxs-using-mantid: reduction
 - arcs_analyze_beam: analyze ARCS beam by placing multiple monitors at the sample position


Instrument configuration
------------------------

Positions and orientations of components and component parameters
are hard-coded in etc/arcs_moderator2sample.
Chaning them can be done with cmd line args or modification
of the pml file.
But be very careful because positional information
is also used in module
ARCS/nxs/raw.py.

Detector configuration is in mcvine-resources/instruments/ARCS/detsys/ARCS.xml.fornxs
(see applications/arcs-neutrons2events).
This information is also used in ARCS/nxs/raw.py

These information is scattered a bit, 
and it means there should be a better design to centralize
the configurations.
