SNS SEQUOIA instrument simulation.

Applications
------------

 - sequoia_beam: beam simulation
   - run sequoia-m2s
     - run sequoia_moderator2sample
   - run post processing
 - sequoia-neutrons2nxs: scattered neutrons to det system and generate event mode nxs
   - sequoia-neutron2events
   - sequoia-events2nxs
 - sequoia-nxs-populate-Eidata: add Ei-related data into event mode nxs
 - sequoia-reduce-nxs-using-mantid: reduction
 - sequoia_analyze_beam: analyze SEQUOIA beam by placing multiple monitors at the sample position


Instrument configuration
------------------------

Positions and orientations of components and component parameters
are hard-coded in etc/sequoia_moderator2sample.
Changing them can be done with cmd line args or modification
of the pml file.
But be very careful because positional information
is also used in module
SEQUOIA/nxs/raw.py.

Detector configuration is in mcvine-resources/instruments/SEQUOIA/nxs/SEQUOIA.xml.fornxs
(see applications/sequoia-neutrons2events).
This information is also used in SEQUOIA/nxs/raw.py

These information is scattered a bit, 
and it means there should be a better design to centralize
the information about instrument and detector configurations.
